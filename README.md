#Robot Sensing and Navigation Project Overview

Project Overview:
Lane detection is a crucial component of autonomous driving systems, enabling vehicles to accurately identify and track lanes on roads. The goal of this project is to implement a robust and efficient lane detection algorithm using classical computer vision methods. By utilizing techniques such as edge detection, Hough transforms, and perspective transformations, we intend to achieve accurate lane detection under various driving conditions.

Objectives:

Develop a lane detection pipeline that accurately identifies lane markings in real-time.
Explore classical computer vision algorithms, including Canny edge detection and Hough transforms, to process road images effectively.
Investigate perspective transformations to rectify the lane region and ensure consistency across different camera angles.
Implement methods to handle challenging road conditions, such as shadows, occlusions, and varying lighting conditions.
Evaluate the performance of the lane detection system on diverse datasets, comparing it with existing state-of-the-art approaches.
Scope and Expected Outcomes:
The project will encompass designing, implementing, and testing the lane detection pipeline using Python and relevant computer vision libraries. The outcome of this project will be a fully functional lane detection system capable of processing video streams in real-time, accurately identifying lane boundaries in challenging scenarios.

Significance:
Lane detection using classical computer vision techniques remains relevant due to its simplicity, efficiency, and reliability. This approach serves as a strong baseline for more advanced autonomous driving systems, providing an understanding of traditional computer vision methods in the context of modern self-driving technology.
